# AUDIT FINDINGS

Every defect found while auditing the baseline and while building the migration, with what it was,
how it was found, and what was done. Ordered by when it was found.

Findings in **existing code** are marked `BASELINE`. Findings in code written during this migration
are marked `NEW` — they are recorded with the same weight, because a defect found in your own work an
hour after writing it is the same defect it would have been in six months.

The audit narrative is in `INDEPENDENT_AUDIT.md`; this is the register.

## F-01 · `make integration` ran one package · BASELINE · P2 · FIXED

**Found by** running `make integration` and enumerating what it executed.

`./test/integration/...` contains exactly one package. The database-backed proof of the financial
core lives behind `//go:build integration` inside `internal/` and `cmd/` — 40 packages that the
target never ran. `make test-all` reported success having executed none of them.

CI had already grown an inline shell loop that enumerated the tag correctly, with a comment saying
the workaround would live there "until that target takes a package list". So CI was sound and the
local command was not, and two definitions of "the integration tests" were free to drift.

**Fix.** `scripts/inttest`: one program both call. It enumerates the build tag, gives each package
its own database (they cannot share one — `internal/event` truncates tables others count rows in),
and refuses to run at all if it finds fewer than two packages, so a broken enumeration fails loudly
instead of passing in a tenth of a second.

## F-02 · The cross-tenant cursor test could not reach its assertion · BASELINE · P2 · FIXED

**Found by** running `test/security` on a database other suites had already used.

`TestLedger_AForgedCursorCannotCrossTenants` selected the *first* customer-owned journal row and then
asserted it belonged to customer-a. Any other suite posting a row first broke the precondition — and
it broke **before** the cross-tenant assertion, so SEC-003 was unproven.

The API is not defective: it takes the owner as a bound parameter and the cursor only as a keyset
position. The defect is that the test could not demonstrate it. Note the asymmetry that made this
worth fixing rather than shrugging at: a security test that stops before its assertion *fails*, which
is survivable; the same test passing while proving nothing would not be.

**Fix.** Select the row by owner instead of asserting about whichever row sorted first. Verified on
three consecutive runs against the same database.

## F-03 · Isolation was direction-blind · NEW · P1 · FIXED

**Found by** `TestIsolation_PayoutPathIsGatedAtBothSteps`, written before the design was believed.

The first draft of `CheckDomains` took only the *set* of domains a transaction touched and permitted
the pair if a conversion was declared in **either** direction. `PAYOUT_PENDING → INTERNAL_CREDIT` is
deliberately ungated so an in-flight payout can always be unwound, so a direction-blind check let
that ungated return path authorise the gated `INTERNAL_CREDIT → PAYOUT_PENDING` reserve step —
defeating `PAYOUT_RESERVE` for anyone able to post a two-domain transaction.

**Fix.** `CheckConversion(from, to, caps)` is directional and is the authority. `CheckPosting`
additionally requires a cross-domain transaction to *declare* which conversion it is, and the
declaration to match the domains present. Regression: `TestIsolation_DirectionIsLoadBearing`.

## F-04 · `credit.Issue` double-credited inside a larger posting · NEW · P1 · FIXED

**Found by** `TestIntegration_BuyMovesValueExactlyWhereItShould`, which asserted the creator's
balance and got twice the fee.

`Issue` did two things: post the movement and record the provenance. A native-market trade already
credits the seller and the creator as legs of a six-entry, two-asset posting, so calling `Issue`
there posted a *second* transaction and credited them again. Provenance and balance then disagreed,
which `VerifyProvenance` caught immediately afterwards.

**Fix.** Split into `Issue` (post + record) and `RecordLot` (record against a posting the caller
already made). The database already refused provenance for units no journal transaction moved, so the
second half of the bug was contained; the first half was real.

## F-05, F-06 · The state-change binding was narrower than its purpose · BASELINE · P2 · FIXED

**Found by** applying migration 00603's binding to `native_assets`.

`cp_require_transition` read `NEW.id`, because every table it guarded had an `id` primary key. A
native asset IS its registry entry and is keyed by `asset_id`; giving it a surrogate key so one
trigger could find it would be the tail wagging the dog.

Separately, the flag was a single value, so an entity could change state only **once** per
transaction: a second flag overwrote the first, and at commit the earlier update found the later
state and was refused. Creating and launching an asset does exactly that.

**Fix.** The function takes an optional id-column argument, and the flag accumulates with membership
checking. Both are widenings — every existing trigger passes one argument and is unaffected — and
membership is exactly as strong as equality was, because writing an immutable transition row is still
the only way to set the flag.

## F-07 · Two SQL statements were not provably constant · NEW · P2 · FIXED

**Found by** `test/security`'s SQL-source analysis in the full sweep. It proves every statement in the
repository is built from constants, so no request-derived string can be concatenated into one.

`internal/credit` assembled a `WHERE` clause from literals and used an `ORDER BY` computed from a Go
map at init. Both were safe and neither was *provably* safe.

**Fix.** Not weakening the check — weakening it for one package weakens it for every package. The
`ORDER BY` is a constant, both lot filters are parameters of one constant statement, and
`TestConsumptionOrderSQL_MatchesTheMap` asserts the constant still implements the Go rank map exactly,
so the map remains the authority and the constant cannot drift.

## F-08, F-09 · Two fixtures broke under the second run · NEW · P2/P3 · FIXED

`internal/ledger`'s value-domain tests created a Credit asset per call, and migration 00711 permits
exactly one — green on a fresh database, red on the second run of the same one. `internal/valuation`'s
asset fixture predated required value domains and had not been caught by the mechanical sweep because
it constructs its asset differently from the others.

Neither was reachable from any test run in isolation. They are the argument for `scripts/inttest`
existing, and for the standing rule that every suite is run twice.

## F-10 · Payout shortfalls were explained from the wrong set · NEW · P2 · FIXED

**Found by** `TestIntegration_ReversibleFundingIsNeverPayable`, which expected `FUNDING_NOT_FINAL`
among the reasons and got only `INSUFFICIENT_ELIGIBLE_VALUE`.

The shortfall explanation was computed from `EligibleLots`, which filters **out** exactly the lots
whose refusal is the answer. A user whose entire balance was ineligible was told "insufficient" and
never why — which is the least useful possible answer to "why can I not withdraw".

**Fix.** Explaining a refusal starts from the refused set. The engine now enumerates every lot the
account holds and reports the distinct reasons.

## F-11 · Two payout states were unreachable · NEW · P2 · FIXED

`VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` could not reach `VERIFIED` (a user may complete identity verification out of
band, with no pending provider flow to sit in), and `SUBMITTED` could not reach `MANUAL_REVIEW`,
which is where a settlement that cannot be recorded has to go.

Both were gaps in the transition table rather than deliberate restrictions.
`TestState_EveryTransitionTargetIsDeclared` now asserts every declared state is reachable, so a
decorative state cannot be added again without noticing.

## F-12 · A rail reported itself implemented with nothing behind it · NEW · P2 · FIXED

**Found by** writing the BLOCKERS entry for the hosted-partner rail and noticing that the sentence
"no adapter exists" contradicted `Implemented() == true`.

The Settlement Compiler refuses to route to an unimplemented rail; reporting `true` would have let it
route to nothing. PART XXII names this failure mode exactly: "do not implement live unsupported
products merely because an interface exists".

**Fix.** `RailHostedPartner.Implemented()` returns `false` until an adapter exists, with the test
asserting it.

## F-13 · A market test asserted absolute balances on a shared account · NEW · P3 · FIXED

Every market quotes against the same Credit asset, so the platform's `MARKET_RESERVE` and fee
accounts are shared by every market — and, in a test, by every test that ran before. Asserting an
absolute balance passed only on a virgin database. The test now asserts deltas, and the shared-account
property became the `VerifyReserves` control-account invariant rather than being worked around.

## Findings deliberately NOT raised

Stated so their absence is a decision rather than an oversight:

- **The chart of accounts is duplicated between Go and SQL.** Both were extended together and a test
  pins the Go side's shape, but nothing mechanically proves the two lists are identical. Worth a
  generator or a cross-check test; it is a maintainability risk, not a defect.
- **Capability activation is not enforced in the database.** Migration 00710 says so explicitly and
  gives the reason: a gate is keyed by environment, and a connection carries no environment the
  application could not simply assert. Adding a session GUC would look like a control and be none.
- **`internal/compliance` is 248 lines with one test.** It is the thinnest financial package in the
  tree and was already flagged in the KEEP/MODIFY matrix as needing a real `ComplianceDecision`. It
  is under-built rather than wrong.
- **`internal/instruments` has 593 lines and one test function** for a package with status authority
  over what may be traded. Under-tested for its authority; not observed to be incorrect.
